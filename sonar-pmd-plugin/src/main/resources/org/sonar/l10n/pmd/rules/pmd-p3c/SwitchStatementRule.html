In a switch block, each case should be finished by break/return. If not, a note should be included to describe at which case it will stop. Within every switch block, a default statement must be present, even if it is empty.
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
    switch (x) {
        case 1:
            break;
        case 2:
            break;
        default:
    }
</pre>
