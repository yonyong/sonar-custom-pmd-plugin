Every class should include information of author(s) and date.<br>
Note: When setting template in IDE, the format of author in IDEA is ${USER}, while in Eclipse is ${user} (Case sensitive).
The format of date is 'yyyy/MM/dd'.
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
    /**
     * Demo class
     *
     * @author keriezhang
     * @date 2016/10/31
     */
    public class CodeNoteDemo {
    }
</pre>
