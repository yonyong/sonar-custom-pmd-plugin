Since NullPointerException can possibly be thrown while calling the equals method of Object, equals should be invoked by a constant or an object that is definitely not null.
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
    public void f(String str){
        String inner = "hi";
        if (inner.equals(str)) {
            System.out.println("hello world");
        }
    }
</pre>
