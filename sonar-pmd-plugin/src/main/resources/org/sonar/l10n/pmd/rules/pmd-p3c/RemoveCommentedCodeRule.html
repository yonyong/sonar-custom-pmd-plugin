Codes or configuration that is noticed to be obsoleted should be resolutely removed from projects.
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
 public static void hello() {
    /// Business is stopped temporarily by the owner.
    // Business business = new Business();
    // business.active();
    System.out.println("it's finished");
 }
</pre>
