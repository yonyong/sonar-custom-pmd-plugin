Single line comments in a method should be put above the code to be commented, by using // and multiple lines by using /* */.
Examples:
<pre>
    public void method() {
        // Put single line comment above code. (Note: align '//' comment with code)
        int a = 3;

        /**
        * Some description about follow code. (Note: align '/**' comment with code)
        */
        int b = 4;
    }
</pre>
